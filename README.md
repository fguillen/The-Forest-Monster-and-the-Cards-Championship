# The Forest Monster and the Cards Championship

You are the Forest Monsters, you just want Cards to participate in the Cards Championship

In order to gather the cards you need, you must venture onto the human-made road that runs through your forest and scare the passing humans into tossing their cards aside.

Once you've collected enough cards, you can return to the safety of the deep forest and prepare for battle against other Forest Monster.
